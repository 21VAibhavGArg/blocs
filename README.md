# ðŸ§  Challenges we ran into

### Boring Discord Servers

- Ever since 2020, Events are going online! This calls for a revamp of our event infrastructure as more and more events are held online or hybrid.
- Discord servers are not a good interface for hosting events, they can get overwhelming, un-navigable boring as the size of the event grows.
  - What we're trying to do is we're making a **virtual, but extremely visual representation** of an event, A virtual Space for events
  - You can visualize and "live" the event just like offline events
  - Some of the key features include
    - **VIRTUAL ROOMS**
      - Rooms for All Webinars
      - Rooms for Minor Events
      - Rooms for Sponsors
      - Rooms for Networking
    - **THEMED MAPS**
      - All events are different, which calls for the need to be able to build UIs that cater to the events needs
      - You can _make your own map_ for your events
    - **INTERACTIVE OBJECTS**
      - These virtual spaces can have interactive objects, when a user visits these objects they respond with premade templates.
      - Examples:
        - **Zoom Bots** - create zoom meeting links, instantaneously
        - **FAQ Bots** - Ask anything about the event!
        - **Advertisment Bots**
